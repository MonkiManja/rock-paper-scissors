The odin project - Foundations - 3rd project

IMPORTANT: This website is not intended to be reactive, it's not asked in the exercise. Maybe in the future i add some media queries to improve it and just for enjoyment.

Now it has an user interface and some goofy adds that made just for fun. I have a important bug to fix in the win-loss counter, but i think it's not that important rn. So it's not completed, but i'm happy with it as it is. Maybe in the future i fix some things and improve it a little bit :).
