The odin project - Foundations - 3rd project

I did this code on my own and edited some functionalities so it will work in the project guidelines.
Implemented a better solution (in my opinion) for the element selection.
Maybe i could make a function so it translates from text to number. But at the time i prefer using numbers than typing "rock", "paper" or "scissor".

So this is it. I will come back in a few days :)
